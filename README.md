# Introduction to Web Security Essentials

## Overview
Welcome to the "Introduction to Web Security Essentials" project! In this repository, you will explore the fundamentals of web security, including common vulnerabilities and best practices to safeguard web applications. Understanding how to protect your web applications from malicious attacks is crucial for developers, system administrators, and anyone involved in web development.

## Topics Covered:
- **Injection Attacks**: Learn about injection attacks, including SQL Injection and other injection vulnerabilities, how they work, and ways to prevent them.
- **Broken Access Control**: Understand how attackers exploit broken access control mechanisms and how to implement proper access control techniques to secure your applications.
- **Broken Authentication**: Learn about common authentication vulnerabilities, such as weak login systems and password management flaws, and how to mitigate them to ensure secure user authentication.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Understand SSRF attacks, where attackers can send unauthorized requests from the server, and learn how to prevent them.
- **Web Security Best Practices**: Explore techniques to ensure the security of your web applications, including input validation, HTTPS, and more.

## Why Web Security is Important:
Web security is a critical aspect of modern web development. With more and more sensitive data being shared and stored online, it is crucial to protect your applications from malicious threats. Hackers are constantly looking for vulnerabilities, and even small mistakes can lead to significant security breaches.
